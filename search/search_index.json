Our Dagstuhl Seminar takes a different perspective \u2013 we wish to improve the algorithm practitioner, arming them with a recipe book for improving any one of a broad class of optimization methods (black-box methods) on any given problem, particularly focusing on real-world problems. In order to establish such a recipe book, we must look to real-world problems and first understand how they arrive on the desk of an optimization practitioner. The formulation of the problem itself is often (though not always) \u201cmessy\u201d with many crucial details missing (such as what the objective(s) are, what the decision space is, and what the constraints are)! But even when such details are apparently in place, the practitioner must remember they are choices, and it will be well to understand who has made those choices and why. At a second level, one must understand how many times the optimization problem must be solved, with what frequency, on what machines, with what data and simulators, and so on. At another level, the practitioner must understand uncertainty in the problem, how the solution is represented, how it will be used in practice, what current solution methods are used, and how they were arrived at. By considering these and a large host of other factors, the practitioner can then understand how they might go about leveraging all that domain knowledge to tailor an optimization method for that problem to achieve the best possible tuned method. The challenge for us all is to be able to do this for any given problem and to have tailoring strategies that work well for any (or a wide range of) black-box methods. We know that such general tailoring methods exist in broad outline in the advice given in old textbooks [1], but it is a long time since they were updated for modern optimization methods and modern infrastructure, such as our modern methods of benchmarking algorithms. The purpose of this Dagstuhl Seminar is to audit the current experience that exists in the field, pool it, and start to describe that experience in a way that goes beyond anecdote (although anecdotes can be useful) and moves us toward advice or recipes that actually work in practice. To achieve this, we aim to bring together researchers from a diverse range of backgrounds involved in real-world optimization from the customer side, the algorithm design or theoretical side, or practitioners who have already experienced successes and failures in the endeavor of tailoring algorithms to problems. The format of our seminar will be structured so that we hear from the cross-section of experienced and inexperienced practitioners, algorithm designers and customers, right from the start. We will then self-organize to achieve our aim of sharing our pooled experience and shaping it into practical, searchable and up-to-date advice on leveraging domain knowledge. [1] L.

They provided 4 months of historical data about where their existing fleet were based and the trips they conducted, including start and end times and geographic location. We were also given information about the vehicle types and which vehicles were allowed to do which trips. Why was tailoring needed? Not too much tailoring was needed but there were some particulars that had to be accounted for: Jobs (i.e. trips) have a type of vehicle which (historically) executed them, but if needed certain other types of vehicles can do the trip. For example, a small car originally did the trip, can be done by a van. Vehicles can be swapped between geographical bases if needed and if the swap does not mean that the vehicle home base cannot cover its own trips. It does not make sense to try and remove a type of vehicle from a base if there are none there or maybe if there are a small amount there. This led to a semi-guided mutation design. Baseline algorithm Upper level: stochastic local search; lower level: constructive heuristic. Motivations for choice: we wanted to keep it simple as possible and explainable for the user. No need to use fancy algorithms if a simple approach can obtain results. Tailoring process Adding in constraints (part of the operators); added additional vehicle/machine swap operation; semi-guided mutation. What was tailored Aspects of the algorithmic operators were tailored. This included the nature of the mutation operator and how it ensured that mutated solutions are feasible within the specific constraints of the problem. Main problem characteristics Choose most important ones: low-dimensional at upper level, high-dimensional at lower level; highly constrained (some soft and some hard); offline; there is an existing solution that works(current fleet); is a simplified version of what is eventually sought (optimising routes, carbon as well); low data sensitivity.

Tailoring process Design a superstructure problem representation to ensure the number of variables stays fixed (the existing representation would change the number of variables regularly). This made it possible to use standard EA frameworks . Modify algorithms designed for a single variable type to handle two variable types. ( Add existing standard mutation + crossover operators to handle variable types the algorithm cannot handle natively.) This made it possible to run an algorithm at all. Add equal penalty value for any solution that is infeasible . This led to only a very small number of feasible solutions, and not much optimisation yet. Penalty value based on the number of constraint violations (larger penalty for more violations). This led to more feasible solutions, and actually being able to optimise something. Design a problem-specific initialisation operator to ensure all initial solutions are feasible. This, combined with the next three steps, led to much better Pareto front approximations. Design a problem-specific mutation operator for the binary variables to ensure (standard operator was used for continuous variables, since there were no constraints on those) Remove the standard crossover operator , because it would cause many constraint violations (a new problem-specific crossover operator might be designed later, but proved to be very difficult to do) Add repair function was used to proportionally scale the continuous variables after mutation to match an equality constraint on them.

This did not make much of a difference in the quality of the Pareto front approximation. Partial success : Although the developed approach worked in principle, it was quite limited in the size of the designs it could handle. For larger designs more modifications would be needed to ensure the problem-specific operators would not get stuck in a (fairly) local region of the search space.
