# [Automatic Train Operation](_No response_)

## Problem Description

Automatic Train Operation Pipeline. Optimizing parameter values of the modules in the automation pipeline, minimizing energy consumption & driving duration

## Why was tailoring needed?

Baseline algorithm that was tailored (if it exists), motivation for choice: MO-SMAC (large search space and low budget), NSGA-II

## Baseline algorithm

_No response_

## Tailoring process

* What was tailored (Problem model, mutation operator)
* Faster evaluations through a more efficient implementation
* Add penalty if solution is not applicable

## What was tailored

_No response_

## Main problem characteristics

* 10 dimensions
* Multi-objective (2 objectives)
* Mixed types of variables (continuous, discrete)
* Deterministic
* Evaluations (~5-30mins)
