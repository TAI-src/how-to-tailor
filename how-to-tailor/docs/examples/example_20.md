# [Anticipation and flexibility in dynamic scheduling](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207540500077140)

## Problem Description

Scheduling on a rolling planning horizon

## Why was tailoring needed?

The time linkage in the problem makes it sub-optimal to optimise over each horizon.

## Baseline algorithm

Evolutionary algorithm

## Tailoring process

Modify the objective function to make sure the resulting solution will remain flexible in future time steps, by penalising early idle time.

## What was tailored

Objective function

## Main problem characteristics

rolling time horizon; new jobs arriving over time
