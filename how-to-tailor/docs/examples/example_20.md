# [Flexible jobs shop scheduling with additional constraints](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_Fm9-S8AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=_Fm9-S8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)

## Problem Description

Flexible job shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times.

## Why was tailoring needed?

Many constraints and multi-objective.

## Baseline algorithm

GCPSO

## Tailoring process

The first attempt at handling the constraints was done by means of a penalty function which ended in disaster. All the computational time was used to obtain a feasible solution. Then, a heuristic was implemented to convert the continuous problem representation (job priorities) into a schedule - remaining within the feasible space.

## What was tailored

Encoding of continuous solutions to discrete schedules.

## Main problem characteristics

- Discrete variables
- Many constraints
- Multi-objective
